### Context

This dataset was completely made manually by extracting audio from sources available on internet sites like Google and Youtube and saved as  .wav audio format. 


### Content

The dataset consists of wav-format audio files which are of length 3-seconds. They contain the siren sound of Emergency Vehicles - Ambulance and Firetruck. A third category named Traffic also exists where it contains 3-second .wav format audio files of plain traffic sound. Each category contains 200 sound files, 200 Spectrogram images for each audio file and a python script for converting each audio file to its spectrogram.

### Acknowledgements

The below dataset was scraped from Youtube videos and from various websites containing the related audio. 


### Inspiration

This dataset was custom made in relation to a Machine Learning project. The lack of availability of siren vehicle sound dataset sources led us to develop a handmade dataset by scraping audio data from various internet sources.
